# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Technologies Used

- Developed with NodeJS, starting with a Vite project
- React:
  - App composed from functional components
  - Forms and inputs made using controlled components, state, and hooks
  - Webpage organized by routers
  - Global data distributed by contexts
  - Packaged by webpack
- HTTP: API calls to manage database, maintain persistence
